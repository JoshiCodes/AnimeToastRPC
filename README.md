## Install
First you have to install <a href="https://premid.app/">PreMid</a> for your OS and your Browser.
Then clone the Repository in a Folder of your choice
After that, open Premid as Browser Extension and hold "SHIFT" and Click "Load Extensions" (German: "Erweiterung wird geladen")
In the Window that Pop-Up, choose the "/dist" Folder of this Repository.
Thats it!

## The Presence stopped working, what now?
Don't panic. If you restarted your Browser, it could be that the Presence is no longer loaded. In that case, simply redo the Install Process.
If this does not work, and you are sure its no Problem with PreMid, AnimeToast could have changed their Site Structure. In that case, i will update the Presence as soon as i can.

## Why is this Presence not in the PreMid Store?
I have nothing to do with AnimeToast, so i dont know if i am allowed to upload the Presence for it. Also, im unsure how the laws are for the Website. I dont want to get in Trouble.
